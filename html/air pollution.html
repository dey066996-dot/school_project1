 Air pollution is the presence of substances in the air that are harmful to humans, other living beings or the environment. Pollutants can be gases, like ozone or nitrogen oxides, or small particles like soot and dust. Both outdoor and indoor air can be polluted. Outdoor air pollution comes from burning fossil fuels for electricity and transport, wildfires, some industrial processes, waste management, demolition and agriculture. Indoor air pollution is often from burning firewood or agricultural waste for cooking and heating.Other sources of air pollution include dust storms and volcanic eruptions. Many sources of local air pollution, especially burning fossil fuels, also release greenhouse gases that cause global warming. However, air pollution may limit warming locally.

<h2>Causes of air pollution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fossil fuel combustion: Burning gasoline, diesel, and coal for vehicles, power plants, and heating releases harmful pollutants.</li>
<li>Industrial emissions: Factories and industrial processes emit various gases and particulate matter. </li>
<li>Deforestation: Clearing forests reduces the number of trees that absorb carbon dioxide, increasing its concentration in the atmosphere. </li>
<li>Agricultural practices: The use of synthetic fertilizers and the burning of agricultural waste contribute to air pollution. </li>
<li>Open garbage burning: This process releases toxins and soot that contribute to air pollution. </li>
<li>Natural sources: Volcanoes, wildfires, and dust storms can also release pollutants into the atmosphere. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Effects of air pollution</h2>
<h3>Human health:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Respiratory problems: Asthma, bronchitis, and lung cancer. </li>
<li>Cardiovascular issues: Heart attacks and strokes. </li>
<li>Other issues: Increased risk of other cancers and developmental problems in children. </li>
<li>Irritation: Eye, nose, and throat irritation, along with nausea and headaches. </li>
</ul>
