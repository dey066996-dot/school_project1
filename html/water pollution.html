<h1>WATER POLLUTION </h1>

Water pollution is the contamination of water bodies, with a negative impact on their uses. It is usually a result of human activities. Water bodies include lakes, rivers, oceans, aquifers, reservoirs and groundwater. Water pollution results when contaminants mix with these water bodies. Contaminants can come from one of four main sources. These are sewage discharges, industrial activities, agricultural activities, and urban runoff including stormwater.  Water pollution may affect either surface water or groundwater. This form of pollution can lead to many problems. One is the degradation of aquatic ecosystems. Another is spreading water-borne diseases when people use polluted water for drinking or irrigation. Water pollution also reduces the ecosystem services such as drinking water provided by the water resource.</p>

<h2>Causes of water pollution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Industrial waste: Factories and mines release toxic chemicals, heavy metals (like mercury, lead, and arsenic), and other pollutants into water bodies. </li>
<li>Agricultural runoff: Pesticides, herbicides, and fertilizers from farms can seep into rivers, lakes, and groundwater. </li>
<li>Sewage and domestic waste: Untreated sewage, which contains pathogens, is often dumped directly into water sources. Other household waste also contributes to pollution. </li>
<li>Plastic and solid waste: The dumping of plastic bottles, containers, and other non-biodegradable waste harms aquatic life and can persist in the environment for long periods. </li>
<li>Oil spills: Accidental oil spills from ships and pipelines can have devastating and immediate effects on marine ecosystems. </li>
<li>Urbanization and deforestation: Increased urban runoff and soil erosion from deforestation can carry pollutants into water. </li>
<li>Natural causes: Volcanoes, animal waste, and soil erosion can also contribute to natural water pollution. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Effects of water pollution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Health problems: Contaminated water can spread diseases such as cholera, typhoid, hepatitis, and diarrhea. Exposure to heavy metals can lead to cancers, neurological disorders, and other serious health issues. </li>
<li>Harm to aquatic life: Pollutants can kill fish and other aquatic organisms, disrupt their reproductive processes, and damage their habitats. </li>
<li>Ecosystem imbalance: Water pollution can lead to nutrient imbalances (eutrophication) and a decrease in dissolved oxygen, making it difficult for aquatic life to survive. </li>
<li>Food chain contamination: Toxins in polluted water can accumulate in the bodies of fish and other sea creatures. When humans consume these animals, they ingest the toxins, which can lead to a range of health problems. </li>
</ul>
