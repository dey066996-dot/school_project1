<h1>PLASTIC POLLUTION</h1>

<p>
Plastic pollution is the accumulation of plastic objects and particles (e.g. plastic bottles, bags and microbeads) in the Earth's environment that adversely affects humans, wildlife and their habitat.Plastics that act as pollutants are categorized by size into micro-, meso-, or macro debris. Plastics are inexpensive and durable, making them very adaptable for different uses; as a result, manufacturers choose to use plastic over other materials.However, the chemical structure of most plastics renders them resistant to many natural processes of degradation and as a result they are slow to degrade. Together, these two factors allow large volumes of plastic to enter the environment as mismanaged waste which persists in the ecosystem and travels throughout food webs.Plastic pollution can afflict land, waterways and oceans. It is estimated that 1.1 to 8.8 million tonnes of plastic waste enters the ocean from coastal communities each year. </p>

<h2>Causes of plastic pollution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Overuse of single-use plastics: Items like bags, bottles, and packaging are major contributors because they are often discarded after one use. </li>
<li>Improper waste management: Inefficient systems for collecting and processing waste allow plastic to leak into the environment. </li>
<li>Littering and dumping: The direct act of discarding plastic in inappropriate places, including rivers and oceans, is a primary source. </li>
<li>Inadequate recycling: Not all plastics are recyclable, and current recycling practices are not always sufficient to handle the volume of plastic produced. </li>
<li>Breakdown into microplastics: Larger plastic items break down into smaller micro and nanoplastics due to UV radiation and other factors. Additionally, synthetic textiles and tires shed microplastics. </li>
</ul>

<h2>Effects of plastic pollution</h2>
<ul>
<li>Environmental contamination: Plastic pollutes land, water, and air, with chemicals leaching into soil and groundwater. </li>
<li>Wildlife harm: Animals can die from ingesting plastic or becoming entangled in it. Marine animals are particularly at risk. </li>
<li>Microplastics in the food chain: Microplastics are ingested by small organisms and accumulate in larger animals, including humans, through the food chain. </li>
<li>Human health risks: Ingested microplastics can cause inflammation. The production and disposal of plastic can release chemicals that are linked to various health problems. </li>
<li>Climate change contribution: The production of plastic from fossil fuels and the incineration of plastic waste contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. </li>
<li>Ecosystem disruption: Plastic debris can clog drains, leading to urban flooding, and disrupt ecosystems by altering nutrient balance. </li>
</ul>
